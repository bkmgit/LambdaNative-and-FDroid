Android applications.  We will try out some of these applications.

## Install an application from F-Droid

On your Android device, open an internet browser and go to
[https://f-droid.org/][https://f-droid.org].

There should be a button `download F-droid`, press on this button
and wait for F-Droid to be downloaded.  Once downloaded, attempt to
install it - you may need to temporarily enable permissoins for
installation of applications from the files folder.

Once F-Droid is installed on your Android device, browse the applications
available on F-Droid and install one on your Android device.  You may
need to give the F-Droid application permissions to install applications.

If you have F-Droid installed and have installed an application,
try out the application and describe what it does.  Write down

If you do not have F-Droid installed, browse

and describe two applications you find interesting.  Write down
where you can obtain the source code for these applications.
